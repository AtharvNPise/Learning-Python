									::PYTHON::										``````````what is Python?````````````````--> It was created by Guido van Rossum--> Released in 1991.Used for:								:Python can do:`````````								```````````````--> Web Development (server-side)				--> Python can be used on a server to create web applications.--> Software Development					--> Python can be used alongside software to create workflow.--> mathematics							--> Python can connect to the database system. It can also read and modify files --> System Scripting						--> Python can used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.							        --> Python can be used for the rapid prototyping, or for the production ready software development.Why Python ?																	:GOOD TO KNOW:````````````																	``````````````--> Work on Different Platform (Windows, Mac, Linux,)										--> Most recent major version of Python is Python 3.(3.13.1)--> simpler syntax similar to English language.											--> Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse.--> It has syntax that allow developers to right programs with fewer line --> Python runs on an interpreter system (Mean that code can be executed as soon as it is written.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------print("Hello, World!")To Check Python Version:- We can find it by importing the sys module````````````````````````import sysprint('Your current python version is:', sys.version)Python Indentation:- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.```````````````````		     Indentation in Python is very important.		     Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.Wrong Indentation:-		     if 5 > 2:		     print("Five is greater than two!")Correct Indentation:-		     if 5 > 2:                  	print("Five is greater than two!")--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------										           ::Variable::											   `````````````Python Variable:  Variables are created when you assign a value to it.```````````````` 											Yha, X/Y ye do variable hai jo kuch value store kr rahe hai 			X = 5			y = "Great Learning"											   ::Comments::											   ````````````Comments: Commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation `````````	In Simple term (Code ke andar comments likhne ki suvidha deta hai)	  Comments start with a #											  ::Statements::											  ``````````````Python Statement:`````````````````    --> A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.		     --> In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.				Example: print("Python is fun!")Many Statements:````````````````		     --> Most Python programs contain many statements.		     --> The statements are executed one by one, in the same order as they are written:		                        Example: print("Hello World!")																		 print("Have a good day.")																	         print("Learning Python is fun!")											   ::Semicolons::											   ``````````````--> Semicolons are optional in Python--> We can write multiple statements on one line by separating them with " ; "						Example: print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!")--> However, if you put two statements on the same line without a separator:  Python will give an error: 		Example: print("Python is fun!") print("Really!") 																	Result: SyntaxError: invalid syntax--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------											     ::OUTPUT/PRINT::											     ````````````````Print Text:   The print() function is used to display text or output values:```````````															Example: print("Hello World!")				 													 print("I am learning Python.")				 													 print("It is awesome!")Double Quotes:	Python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes:`````````````															Example: print("This will work!")																	 print('This will also work!')Print Without a New Line :``````````````````````````	By default, the print() function ends with a new line.				If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter: 		Example: print("Hello World!", end=" ")																	 print("I will print on the same line.")															          OutPut: Hello World! I will print on the same line.Print Numbers :```````````````    use the print() function to display numbers:									Example: print(10)		   we don't put numbers inside double quotes.										 print(200)																	 print(3000)Mix Text and Numbers: we can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma:`````````````````````														Example: print("I am", 35, "years old.")--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------											        ::Variable::												````````````--> Variables are containers for storing data values.--> A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.							       Example: x = 5                     															y = "Python Is Great For Learning"																	print(x)																	      print(y)												::Casting::												```````````--> If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.					      Example:       x = str(3)    # x will be '3'          																     y = int(3)    # y will be 3    																             z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0											      ::Get The Type::											      `````````````````		--> can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.							     Example: x = 5																      y = "AthArv Pise"																      print(type(x))																      print(type(y))--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Date:03-11-2025::`````````````````											     ::Variable Names::											     ```````````````````A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).																Example:	myvar = "John"																		my_var = "John"																		_my_var = "John"																		myVar = "John"																		MYVAR = "John"																		myvar2 = "John"Rule To Create The Variable:													````````````````````````````A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore characterA variable name cannot start with a numberA variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.Multi Words Variable Names::`````````````````````````````	--> Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.	--> There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable1> Camel Case.	Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:								Example: 	myVariableName = "John"2> Pascal Case	Each word starts with a capital letter:					Example: MyVariableName = "John"3> Snake Case.	Each word is separated by an underscore character:									Example:	my_variable_name = "John"	Many Values to Multiple Variables:``````````````````````````````````Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:Example: x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"print(x)print(y)print(z)One Value to Multiple Variables:````````````````````````````````   We can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:					x = y = z = "Atharv"												print(x)												print(y)												print(z)::Unpack a Collection::```````````````````````If we have  a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.								Example: car = ["Mercedes","Range Rover", "Defender"] 					 x,y,z = car				         print(x)				         print(y)Output Variables:`````````````````The Print() Function is often used to output Variable.				Example: X = "I want to Buy Range Rover"											 print(x)In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:										Example: X = "I"											 Y = "want"											 Z = "To"											 A = "Buy"										         B = "Range Rover."										         print(X,Y,Z,A,B)We can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:		   ```				Example: X = "I "				         Y = "want "           				 Z = "To "					 A = "Buy"					 B = "Range Rover."					 print(X + Y + Z )Notice the space character after "I " and "want ", without them the result would be "Iwantto".  <<<<<<--------NOTEFor numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:				Example: X = 10000					 Y = 80000					 print(x + y)Global Variable:```````````````` Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples in the previous pages) are known as global variables.		 Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.						--> Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function 			Example: X = "Nagpur"																	 def myfunc():																		print("I'm From", x)																	 myfunc()Note::--> If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local,and can only be used inside the function.The global Keyword::   ````````````````````     Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.		--> To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.--> If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Date.12/11/2025::								:: Data Type::`````````````````								``````````````--> Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.--> Python has the following data types built-in by default				Text Type:	str		Numeric Types:	int, float, complex		Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range		Mapping Type:	dict		Set Types:	set, frozenset		Boolean Type:	bool		Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview		None Type:	NoneTypeGetting the Data Type:``````````````````````		We can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:					Example: X = 5						 Y = "Atharv"						 Z = 3.5						 A = True						 B = 1j						 print(type(X))						 print(type(Y))						 print(type(Z))						 print(type(A))						 print(type(B))--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------																			::Python Numbers::										``````````````````There are three numeric types in Python:											Example:-````````````````````````````````````````					---->	int											x = 1    # int					---->	float											y = 2.8	 #float					---->	complex											z = 1j   #complex														---->	To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:																	print(type(x))																	print(type(y))																	print(type(z))int:````	int or integer is a whole number, positive or Negative, without decimals of unlimited  length															Example:														````````	x = 1																y = 35656222554887711																z = -3255522																print(type(x))																print(type(y))																print(type(z))Float:``````	Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.														Example:														````````	x = 1.10																y = 1.0																z = -35.59																print(type(x))																print(type(y))																print(type(z))	::NOTEE::-  Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.	`````````   `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````						Example:- x = 35e3							  y = 12E4							  z = -87.7e100Complex:````````Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:																Example:														````````	x = 3+5j																y = 5j																z = -5j																print(type(x))																print(type(y))																print(type(z))Type Conversion:````````````````	You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:					Example::					`````````							X = 1							Y = 99.99							Z = 1967j							a = float(X)							b = int(Y)							c = complex(Z)							print(a)							print(b)							print(c)							print(type(a))							print(type(b))							print(type(c))NOTE::- You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.``````Random Number:``````````````	---->	Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, 	---->	But Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
