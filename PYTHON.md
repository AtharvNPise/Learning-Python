what is Python?

````````````````

--> It was created by Guido van Rossum

--> Released in 1991.



Used for:								:Python can do:

`````````								```````````````

--> Web Development (server-side)				--> Python can be used on a server to create web applications.

--> Software Development					--> Python can be used alongside software to create workflow.

--> mathematics							--> Python can connect to the database system. It can also read and modify files 

--> System Scripting						--> Python can used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.

&nbsp;							        --> Python can be used for the **rapid prototyping,** or for the **production ready software development**.





Why Python ?																	:GOOD TO KNOW:

````````````																	``````````````

--> Work on Different Platform (Windows, Mac, Linux,)										--> Most recent major version of Python is Python 3.(3.13.1)

--> simpler syntax similar to English language.											--> Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse.

--> It has syntax that allow developers to right programs with fewer line 

--> Python runs on an interpreter system (***Mean that code can be executed as soon as it is written.***)

print("Hello, World!")

**To Check Python Version:**- We can find it by importing the ***sys*** module

````````````````````````

import sys

print('Your current python version is:', sys.version)



***Python Indentation***:- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

```````````````````

&nbsp;		     Indentation in Python is very important.



&nbsp;		     Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

***Wrong Indentation:-***
		     if 5 > 2:

&nbsp;		     print("Five is greater than two!")
***Correct Indentation:-***

&nbsp;		     if 5 > 2:

&nbsp;                  	print("Five is greater than two!")

&nbsp;										           ::Variable::

&nbsp;											   `````````````

***Python Variable:***  Variables are created when you assign a value to it.

***````````````````*** 

&nbsp;			X = 5

&nbsp;			y = "Great Learning"

&nbsp;											   ::Comments::

&nbsp;											   ````````````

***Comments:*** Commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation 
***`````````	In Simple term (***Code ke andar comments likhne ki suvidha deta hai***)***



&nbsp;	  Comments start with a ***#***

&nbsp;											  ::Statements::

&nbsp;											  ``````````````



***Python Statement:***

***`````````````````    --> A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.***

&nbsp;		     --> In a programming language, these programming instructions are called ***statements.				Example:*** print("Python is fun!")



***Many Statements:***

***````````````````***

&nbsp;		     --> Most Python programs contain many statements.

&nbsp;		     --> The statements are executed one by one, in the same order as they are written:		                        ***Example:*** print("Hello World!")

&nbsp;																		 print("Have a good day.")

&nbsp;																	         print("Learning Python is fun!")



&nbsp;											   ::Semicolons::

&nbsp;											   ``````````````

--> Semicolons are optional in Python

--> We can write multiple statements on one line by separating them with ***" ; "						Example:*** print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!")





--> However, if you put two statements on the same line without a separator:  ***Python will give an error:* 		<i>Example: </i>**print("Python is fun!") print("Really!") 

&nbsp;																	***Result: SyntaxError: invalid syntax***



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



&nbsp;											     ::OUTPUT/PRINT::

&nbsp;											     ````````````````

***Print Text:***   The ***print() function*** is used to display text or output values:

***```````````															Example: print("Hello World!")***

				 													 ***print("I am learning Python.")***

				 													 ***print("It is awesome!")***



***Double Quotes:***	Python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes:

***`````````````															Example: print("This will work!")***

																	 ***print('This will also work!')***



***Print Without a New Line :***

***``````````````````````````***	By default, the print() function ends with a new line.



&nbsp;				If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter: 		***Example: print("Hello World!", end=" ")***

																	 ***print("I will print on the same line.")***


															        ***OutPut:*** Hello World! I will print on the same line.



***Print Numbers :***

***```````````````***    use the print() function to display numbers:									***Example:*** print(10)

&nbsp;		   ***we don't put numbers inside double quotes.***										 print(200)

&nbsp;																	 print(3000)





***Mix Text and Numbers:*** we can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma:

***`````````````````````***														***Example:*** print("I am", 35, "years old.")

&nbsp;											        ::Variable::

&nbsp;												````````````

--> Variables are containers for storing data values.

--> A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.							       ***Example:*** x = 5

&nbsp;																	y = "Python Is Great For Learning"

&nbsp;																	print(x)

&nbsp;																	print(y)





&nbsp;												::Casting::

&nbsp;												```````````

--> If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.					      ***Example:*** x = str(3)    # x will be '3'

&nbsp;																       y = int(3)    # y will be 3

&nbsp;																       z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0





&nbsp;											      ::Get The Type::

&nbsp;											      `````````````````		

--> can get the data type of a variable with the ***type() function.							     Example: x = 5***

																      ***y = "AthArv Pise"***

&nbsp;																      print(type(x))

&nbsp;																      print(type(y))
